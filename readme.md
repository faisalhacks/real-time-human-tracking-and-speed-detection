# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Real-Time Human Detection and Speed Estimation Using YOLOv8

Welcome to the **Real-Time Human Detection and Speed Estimation** project! This project uses **YOLOv8** for detecting humans in a live webcam feed and estimates their speed based on their movement. It also features a **Gradio** web app for real-time interaction and analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

This project utilizes several powerful libraries and tools to deliver its functionalities:

- **[YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)**: For human detection
- **[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)**: For handling video capture and frame processing
- **[Gradio](https://gradio.app/)**: For creating an interactive web interface
- **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**: For running the project in a cloud environment

## üöÄ **Use Case**

This project has the following use cases:

- **Real-time Human Detection**: Detects humans in a live webcam stream using YOLOv8.
- **Speed Estimation**: Tracks the detected humans and estimates their movement speed.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Provides a Gradio-based interface to view the video feed and speed estimates in real time.
- **Webcam Support**: Works with any webcam connected to your system for capturing live video.

## üì∏ **How It Works**

### 1. **Human Detection**
- YOLOv8 identifies humans in each frame of the video stream.
  
### 2. **Tracking and Speed Estimation**
- The program tracks detected people across frames, calculates the distance they travel, and estimates their speed in meters per second.
  
### 3. **Gradio Web Interface**
- The Gradio app allows users to interact with the webcam feed and see the human detection and speed information in real-time.
